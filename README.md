# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- What was your motivation? I want to become a programmer for a living.
- Why did you build this project? So I can put into practice what I've learned during Prework.
- What problem does it solve? It provides important resumed information that could be helpful for students at the bootcamp while studying.
- What did you learn? I learned how to think like a developer. I learned what HTML, CSS and JavaScript is for, and used that knowledge to create my own web application. I also learned how to use the CL to open files without using the GUI of my computer. I learned how to use the git command flow so I can sync my codes between my local and remote workplace (GitHub) so that my proyect remains updated.
